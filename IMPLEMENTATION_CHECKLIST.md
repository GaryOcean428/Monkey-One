- Merge Safety: +50-70% (from quality gates)
- Confidence Accuracy: +20-30% (from verification)

### Operational Metrics
- Merge Conflicts: Detected before merge
- Code Quality: Gated by quality score
- Traceability: Full source tracking
- Learning: Automated conflict logging

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### Planned
- [ ] Machine learning for merge decisions
- [ ] Adaptive confidence thresholds
- [ ] Additional conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Automated performance testing
- [ ] Pattern recognition in successful merges

### Under Consideration
- [ ] Real-time merge quality monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated conflict resolution suggestions
- [ ] Historical merge analysis tools
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] A/B testing for merge strategies

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Jaccard Similarity Threshold (0.8)**: Chosen to balance between removing duplicates and preserving unique suggestions
2. **Quality Threshold (0.6)**: Set to ensure reasonable quality while not being overly restrictive
3. **Top 3 Solutions**: Balances quality and computational cost
4. **Confidence Boost (0.1)**: Rewards agreement between methods without over-inflating confidence

### Trade-offs
1. **Performance vs Accuracy**: Chose top 3 solutions over all solutions for better performance
2. **Strictness vs Flexibility**: 0.6 quality threshold allows most good merges while blocking problematic ones
3. **Simplicity vs Completeness**: Used heuristic-based impact estimation over complex analysis

### Lessons Learned
1. Multi-source insights significantly improve solution quality
2. Conflict detection and logging is valuable for continuous improvement
3. Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation
4. Comprehensive metadata tracking aids debugging and analysis
