## Test Coverage

### Current Status

- **MessageHandlers Decorator**: 100% coverage
- **BaseAgent**: Comprehensive test suite covering initialization, message handling, and lifecycle management
- **OrchestratorAgent**: Initial test coverage for core functionality
- **Communication Layer**:
  - MessageBroker: Basic test coverage
  - MessageQueue: Comprehensive test suite

### Test Coverage Gaps

1. **Runtime Components**
   - Incomplete coverage for WorkerAgentRuntime
   - Partial coverage for HostAgentRuntime

2. **Agent Implementations**
   - Limited test coverage for:
     - WebSurfer Agent
     - FileSurfer Agent
     - Coder Agent

3. **Tools and Utilities**
   - Minimal test coverage for:
     - ToolPipeline
     - SecurityMiddleware
     - AgentRegistry
     - AgentMonitor

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Expand test coverage for remaining runtime components
2. Create comprehensive test suites for each agent implementation
3. Add tests for utility classes and tools
4. Implement integration tests to verify cross-component interactions
