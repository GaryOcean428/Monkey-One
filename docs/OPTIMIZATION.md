# Bundle Optimization Guide

This document outlines the strategies implemented to optimize bundle sizes in the Monkey-One application.

## Bundle Size Improvements

The application was optimized to reduce large JavaScript chunks and improve loading performance. The main strategies implemented were:

### 1. Granular Code Splitting

- Implemented advanced manual chunking in `vite.config.ts` to separate dependencies based on their usage patterns:
  - Core framework libraries (React, React DOM, React Router)
  - UI component libraries (Radix UI components)
  - AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, Transformers)
  - Utilities and state management
  - Feature-specific modules (agents, chat, tools)

### 2. Dynamic Imports

- Added dynamic imports with React.lazy for various components:
  - Authentication providers
  - UI Components like Sidebar and LoadingOverlay
  - Feature components that aren't needed on initial load

### 3. Config Optimizations

- Set appropriate bundling options:
  - Targeted modern browsers (ES2020)
  - Limited asset inlining to 10KB
  - Enabled code compression (gzip and brotli)
  - Optimized code generation with modern JS features
  - Enhanced tree-shaking and duplicate detection

### 4. Lazy Loading Framework

- Created `loadableChunks.ts` to provide an organized way to lazy-load dependencies
- Implemented route-based preloading to fetch chunks based on user navigation

## Bundle Analysis

Used Rollup Visualizer to identify large dependencies and determine optimal splitting strategies. The stats.html file provides a treemap visualization of bundle sizes.

## Future Optimization Strategies

1. **Implement Import on Visibility**: Defer loading components until they're in or near the viewport

2. **Dynamic Feature Flags**: Conditionally load features based on user permissions or preferences

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Provide basic functionality first, then enhance with additional features as resources load

4. **Server Components**: Consider moving more logic to the server where applicable

5. **Bundle Differential Loading**: Deliver different bundle sets based on browser capabilities

## Monitoring and Analysis

Regularly review bundle sizes with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The visualizer will generate `stats.html` which can be opened to analyze bundle composition and identify new optimization opportunities.
