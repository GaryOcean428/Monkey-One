# Monkey One User Guide

## Getting Started

### Overview

Monkey One is an advanced AI agent system that helps automate tasks, manage workflows, and coordinate multiple specialized agents. The system starts with a conversational interface where you can discuss your needs and develop solutions.

### Core Features

- **Conversational Planning**: Chat with the main agent to scope and plan automations
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents for complex tasks
- **Workflow Management**: Save, reuse, and monitor automated workflows
- **GitHub Integration**: Version control and collaboration for developed solutions

## Using the System

### Initial Interaction

1. Start by chatting with the main conversational agent
2. Describe your task or automation needs
3. The agent will help analyze requirements and suggest an approach
4. Once requirements are clear, the agent will propose a team of specialized agents

### Available Agent Types

- **Conversational Agent**: Main interface for planning and coordination
- **Web Scraper**: Extracts data from websites
- **Form Filler**: Automates form submissions and data entry
- **Code Assistant**: Helps with code generation and modification

### Creating Workflows

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Discuss requirements with the conversational agent
   - Review and refine the proposed solution
   - Approve the agent team composition

2. **Development Phase**
   - Agents work together to build the solution
   - Monitor progress in real-time
   - Provide feedback and adjustments as needed

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Verify the workflow meets requirements
   - Test with sample data
   - Make refinements if needed

4. **Saving & Deployment**
   - Save workflows for future use
   - Configure triggers or schedules
   - Deploy to production environment

### Managing Workflows

#### Saving Workflows

1. Click "Save Workflow" in the workflow panel
2. Provide a name and description
3. Configure any specific settings
4. Save for future use

#### Executing Workflows

1. Select a saved workflow
2. Review configuration
3. Click "Execute" to run
4. Monitor progress in real-time

#### Modifying Workflows

1. Open an existing workflow
2. Make necessary adjustments
3. Test changes
4. Save updated version

### GitHub Integration

#### Connecting to GitHub

1. Connect your GitHub account
2. Create or select a repository
3. Manage workflow code and configurations
4. Collaborate with team members

#### Version Control

- All workflow changes are tracked
- Create branches for development
- Submit pull requests for review
- Maintain history of changes

## Best Practices

### Planning

1. Be specific about requirements
2. Start with simple workflows
3. Test thoroughly before scaling
4. Document assumptions and limitations

### Workflow Design

1. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
2. Use appropriate agent types
3. Include error handling
4. Add validation checks

### Maintenance

1. Regular testing of saved workflows
2. Update configurations as needed
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Keep documentation current

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Communication

- Ensure all required agents are available
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API keys and permissions

#### Workflow Execution

- Validate input data
- Check for timeout settings
