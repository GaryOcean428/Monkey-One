# Dashboard Navigation and Hydration Error Fix

## Issue Description
The dashboard page was throwing React error #306 (hydration error) and navigation was updating the URL but not showing content changes.

## Root Cause
The `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` component was a simple placeholder that only returned static text:
```tsx
const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  return <div>Dashboard Component</div>
}
```

This caused two problems:
1. **Navigation Issue**: The component wasn't rendering any actual dashboard content, so navigating to `/dashboard` would show a blank page with just "Dashboard Component" text
2. **Hydration Error**: The simple component with static text could cause React hydration mismatches, especially after OAuth callback processing which modifies the URL using `window.history.replaceState()`

## Solution
Updated `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` to use the fully-featured `DashboardPanel` component:
```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { DashboardPanel } from '../components/panels/DashboardPanel'

const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  return <DashboardPanel />
}

export default Dashboard
```

## Benefits
1. **Proper Content**: The Dashboard now displays:
   - Active Agents metric card
   - Completed Tasks metric card
   - Memory Usage metric card with progress bar
   - API Calls metric card
   - Recent Activity panel
   - System Status panel with health, backup, and model information

2. **Consistent Rendering**: The DashboardPanel uses static content and Zustand store data, avoiding hydration issues that can occur with dynamic user data

3. **Better UX**: Users now see actual dashboard metrics instead of placeholder text

## Files Changed
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use DashboardPanel instead of placeholder text

## Testing
- Build succeeds: `pnpm run build` ✓
- TypeScript types valid (after removing stale .d.ts files)
- No new test failures introduced
- Dashboard component properly imports DashboardPanel ✓
