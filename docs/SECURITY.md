## Security Best Practices

### Development
```typescript
// Use parameterized queries
const user = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
  [userId]
);

// Implement rate limiting
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
}));

// Secure headers
app.use(helmet());

// CSRF protection
app.use(csrf());
```

### Deployment
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Container security
- Network segmentation

### Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection
- Regular audits

## Incident Response
